# Java Property Service


This project can be used to organize command line arguments which are passed during application startup. The arguments are organized as JPS-Properties which can comfortably accessed during application runtime. Additionally a dynamic info page is generated for each application which is using the JavaProperyService to get an overview about available properties.
